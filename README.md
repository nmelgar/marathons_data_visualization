# Marathons

Since the first marathon in 1896, there have been many of them all around the world. We will analyze different finishing times and how they relate to the associated spatial and temporal information about them.

## Background

In a nod to Greek history, the first marathon in 1896 commemorated the run of the soldier Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon, Greece, to Athens in 490 B.C. with a distance of approximately 25 miles. Later, for the 1908 London Olympics, a 26-mile course was laid out from Windsor Castle to White City stadium. An extra 385 yards was added inside the stadium to position the finish line in front of the royal family's viewing box. 

Despite the success of the 1908 race, it took 13 more years of debate before the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) adopted the 26.2-mile distance as the official marathon. Today, there are more than 500 organized marathons in 64 countries around the world each year, with more than 425,000 marathon finishers in the United States alone. 

Eric J. Allen published an article on marathon runners and they have shared much of the data that we will use. The data has close to 10 million observations.

## The Challenge

Describe the finishing times and how they relate to the associated spatial and temporal information about the marathon. You will look at the individual marathon runners and the marathons themselves. We have been asked to create a short story that describes marathons that could be published in a local newspaper the week before a marathon is to be held in the community.

Data sources available at sources folder in this repository. We will need to use more than one of the data sets provided but not expected all of them.
